### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Eric
#### I am Cloud Infratructure Engineer.

I am deeply passionate about cloud architecture and cybersecurity and enjoy crafting innovative cloud solutions in AWS and Azure environments. My expertise lies in strategically leveraging cloud services to create an interconnected platform that seamlessly integrates storage, compute networks, monitoring, IAM, and serverless architecture services. My technical proficiency extends to using Docker and Linux, along with a well-rounded experience in a widespread open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

Complementing my technical abilities, I bring a solid track record in managing cloud migration projects and implementing Agile methodologies. I am a firm believer in the power of clear and comprehensive documentation. Whenever possible, I harness the capabilities of Draw.io to sketch AWS/Azure architecture diagrams. This aids in the visualization and articulation of infrastructure design and dependencies to both team members and stakeholders. By doing so, we can elevate team efficiency and guarantee that projects are delivered punctually, within budget, and to the highest quality standards.

Overall, the key to successful project execution lies in meticulous documentation, adopting Agile methodologies, and using visualization tools like Draw.io. Inculcating these into my daily workflow, I continually strive to exceed project goals and deliver exceptional results.
